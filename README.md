# E-Clean
"E-Clean" is a project on App Development that aims to generate the data on plastic waste, taking inputs as pictures and locations and producing a proper data visual such as World Heat Map and a general task on it. 
Our project takes pictures as input which are further processed on certain CNN or RCNN Deep Learning Model. Model helps in predicting the plastic waste in a picture along with tagging the type of waste. To store all the data, we’re using ‘Firebase’ as our cloud tech. This project aims toward general awareness on plastic by creating educational data purposely and representing it in visualizations.
